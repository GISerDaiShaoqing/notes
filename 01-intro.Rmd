## What is Cartography?

- O-graphy-of-Carto: the communication of a geographic phenomenon.
- C(Compromise)art(Artistry)o(Opportunity)graph(Graphicacy)y(Why).
- The process of map-making. It depends on who you make a map for and why you make this map.

## Maths for Map Makers

- Coordinates, projection. Three major families of map projections including conic, azimuthal, and cylindrical.
- Exploring the map projection is also interesting.
- Web Mercator caused the error of the area. 
- Choices of projection should fit the purpose of the map and intending to show.

## The Language of Graphics

- Generalization. A good cartographer should Know how the map was in the eye and brain of audience.

- Visual variables: Hue and color mapping, shape, transparency (time-based data), legend.
- John Snow's map-health phenomenon in the spatial context.
- Things to avoid, use of like solid black and go dark gray, too much color, choropleth map-normalize the data and don't show the raw total data.

## Labels and Composition

- Typeface: Arial and Arial Black 13. Used the font in the same family.
- Size: 10 to 12 points.The smallest number of size,s ix to four.
- Color, Halo, used less color as much as possible,  transparency.
- Label locations.
- Somethingaboutmaps.com.
- neat lines.
- Context.

## Going 3D

- Not all map could use 3D. Why would we go 3D? LOD (levels of detail)
- Perspective, its' easy to lie with 3D and map.
- Context and medium is important in 3D.
- Realistic. 

## Mapping Movement and Change

- Time and temporal geography. Animation, statistic.
- Change detection algorithms.
- Spatce-time cubes.
